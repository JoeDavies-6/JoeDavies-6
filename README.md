##### As part of my PhD at the University of Nottingham in the Hirst group I'm working on the development of AI4Green, an open-source and free to use electronic laboratory notebook (ELN) for organic chemists with integrated machine learning and data-driven methods to support and encourage more sustainable chemistry.
##### I'm particularly interested in cheminformatics, machine learning, and the development of software to support chemical research.
